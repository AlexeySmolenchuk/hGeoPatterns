### What is hGeoPatterns
**hGeoPatterns** is a collection of RenderMan plugins for sampling Houdini geometry. This project is a mixture of **RIS** and **HDK** functionality to make operations like sampling and reading arbitrary Houdini Geometry Data in RenderMan shading networks. Similar to familiar **xyzdist**, **prim_attribute**, **nearpoints** VEX functions. OSL shaders, headers and VOP definitions are included to make shader authoring easy.
